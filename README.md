Game of Life is a very interesting concept and can be used as a basepoint for a variety of complex things. This version is a basic version, suitable for those new to the concept. It mimics the behaviour of a dynamic population and is a zero-player game, requiring no players - only the inital configuration. It representa self-replicating machines and can be used to see how patterns can evolve over time. Users are also able to interact with the simulation in a variety of ways. 

The rules are:
  - Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
  - Stasis: A live cell with two or three live enighbours lives on to the next generation
  - Overpopulation: A live cell with more than three live neighbours dies
  - Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell

To interact with the simulation, users can use these keys:
  - ENTER: To start the simulation
  - SPACEBAR: To stop the simulation
  - f KEY: To make the simulation faster
  - s KEY: To make the simulation slower
  - r KEY: For a random state of the grid
  - c KEY: To clear the grid
